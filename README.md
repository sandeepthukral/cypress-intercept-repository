# Cypress intercept command workshop code

This repository is the companion code for the Cypress Intercept command workshop given by Sandeep Singh Thukral.

## How to use

The code given here intended to be used to understand practical uses of the Cypress intercept command

### Executing the tests
Checkout the repository using the following command 
``

Install the dependencies in the folder by running this command
`npm i`

You can now run the tests using either of the commands

`npm run cypress:open`

This opens the cypress runner in visual mode

`npm run cypress:run`

This executes the cypress tests headless using the bundled Electron browser

## Disclaimer
The code has been written to run against the Cypress version 7.0.1. In the future I will try to keep this code updated for a year after the last workshop, but no guarantees here!
